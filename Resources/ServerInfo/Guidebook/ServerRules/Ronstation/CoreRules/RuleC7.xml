  # 7: Zero Tolerance for Multiple Accounts & Account Sharing.

This rule prohibits using alternate accounts or sharing your account. Any violations of this rule will have immediate consequences, up to and including a voucher ban for all accounts involved.


Do not share your account. GAs can not reliably know if the player using your account is you, therefore you are responsible for everything done on and with your account.


Your account is your identity. Protect it.
