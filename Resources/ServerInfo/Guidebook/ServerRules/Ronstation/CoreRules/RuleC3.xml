  # 3. Zero Tolerance for Sexual Content and Shock Content.

This rule prohibits any and all forms of sexual or disturbing content, even if it is in the context of roleplay. Any violations of this rule will have immediate consequences, up-to and including voucher ban(s).

Sexual content is any explicit or implicit reference to body parts, behavior, or sexual acts. Shock content is any behaviour intended to disgust, disturb, or traumatize players out-of-character (OOC).

Romantic roleplay is allowed but it is prohibited to let any romantic roleplay be the focus of your entire round. Any romantic or intimate roleplay requires mutual OOC agreement from all involved players. You must stop immediately if asked to, even if the interaction began consensually.

This server prioritizes player safety. If content risks harming others OOC, it does not belong here.
