reagent-name-rezamine = rezamine
reagent-desc-rezamine = A subtsance naturally occuring in carp flesh, takes a while to metabolize due to it's complex structure, patches up miscelaneous wounds from workplace hazards. Overdose afflicts you with the ick.

reagent-name-pentetic-acid = pentetic acid
reagent-desc-pentetic-acid = Aggresively undoes heat damage, while getting cold & shock damage in the process, with a caustic aftermath. Leaves a harsh caustic burn on overdose.

reagent-name-hexetic-acid = hexetic acid
reagent-desc-hexetic-acid = Angrily restores piercing damage, closing up slash wounds as a side effect, with a caustic attitude. Leaves a harsh caustic burn on overdose.

reagent-name-tetracordrazine = tetracordrazine
reagent-desc-tetracordrazine = A potent stabilizing agent, effectively heals brute, burn, and poison damage on the brink of death; and slightly patches up life threatening wounds. Causes sizeable genetic damage on overdose.

reagent-name-spessacillin = spessacillin
reagent-desc-spessacillin = A naturally sourced poison treatment discovered in a catastrophic industrial accident. Don't worry about it, helps the cough go away.

reagent-name-arcticine = arcticine
reagent-desc-arcticine = A compound that slows the vibration of molecules directly, or in simpler terms, lowers a body's temperature. Treats burns while inflicting frostbite directly. Works regardless of the patient being alive or dead.
