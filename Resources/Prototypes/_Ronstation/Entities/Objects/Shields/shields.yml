# FUCK YOU HOLO SHIELD!!!!!! FUCK YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
# the problems with this thing:
# it works unlike every other shield ingame. they provide a meaningful resistance to damage TEMPORARILY
# they are balanced around breaking, and this thing being UNBREAKABLE makes it absolutely busted no matter how weak it is
# and the reflective nature doesn't help
# originally kept around during development, i'm commenting this out because i CBA dealing with this thing checkfailing

# i should probably delete the sprites....... soon............
