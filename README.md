Ronstation is a fork of the official Space Wizards Federation's Space Station 14 repository.

Space Station 14 is a remake of SS13 that runs on [Robust Toolbox](https://github.com/space-wizards/RobustToolbox), our homegrown engine written in C#.

This is the primary repo for Ronstation, a downstream of Space Station 14. To prevent people forking RobustToolbox, a "content" pack is loaded by the client and server. This content pack contains everything needed to play the game on one specific server.

If you want to host or create content for Ronstation, this is the repo you need. It contains both RobustToolbox and the content pack for development of new content packs. If you want to host or create content for upstream SS14, please kindly visit https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14.
